## Data Types

A data frame is clearly a table, but what exactly is a table in the R
environment? The `str` command gave an indication that each field has it's own
data type.

===

| Type      | Example           |
|-----------+-------------------|
| double    | 3.1, 4, Inf, NaN  |
| integer   | 4L, 0L, 999L      |
| character | 'a', '4', 'üëè'    |
| logical   | TRUE, FALSE       |
| missing   | NA                |

## Data structures

A data frame is a compound object, built from one or more objects that hew to
the basic data types. Like all data frames, "animals" is a "list".

```{python}
type(animals)
```


===

The "list" is one of three one-dimensional data structurs you will regularly
encounter.

- Lists
- Factors
- Vectors

## Vectors

Vectors are an array of values of the same type. Create a vector by combining
elements of the same type together using the function `c()`.

```{python, handout = 1}
counts = [4, 3, 7, 5, 2]
```

===

All elements of an vector must be the same type, so when you attempt to combine
different types they will be coerced to the most flexible type.

```{python}
[1, 2, 'c']
```

===

```{r}
counts <- c(3, 4, 5, 6, 8)
days <- c("S", "M", "T", "W", "Th", "F", "S")
```
