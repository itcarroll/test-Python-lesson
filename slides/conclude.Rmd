## Review

In this introduction to R, we touched on several key parts of scripting for data analysis.

- RStudio panes
- Variable assignment
- Data structures
- Subsetting data
- Functions
- Flow control

## Special characters in R

Perhaps more than most languages, an R script can appear like a jumble of
archaic symbols. Here is a little table of characters to recognize as having
special meaning.

===

| Symbol              | Meaning                      |
| -------             | ---------                    |
| `?`                 | get help                     |
| `#`                 | comment                      |
| `:`                 | sequence                     |
| `::`, `:::`         | access namespaces (advanced) |
| `<-`                | assignment                   |
| `$`, `[ ]`, `[[ ]]` | subsetting                   |
| `% %`               | infix operators, e.g. `%*%`  |
| `{ }`               | statements                   |
| `.`                 |                              |
| `@`                 | slot (advanced)              |

The `.` in R has no fixed meaning and is often used as `_` might be used to
separate words in a variable name.
